# Astro Tutorial

Blog Application hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) using [Astro](https://astro.build/) (and a tiny bit a Preact). Came from running through the tutorial [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/).

Overall, I found Astro to be easy to work with. I'll definitely use this over a SPA Framework like React (I get it's technically a library, but cmon its really a framework at this point) when I'm building Multi-Page Applications like blogs going forward.

Application Currently hosted at https://paul-macfarlane-astro-tutorial.netlify.app/
